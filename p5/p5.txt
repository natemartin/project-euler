Taking the max number of any one prime factor in any of the above factorizations will allow us to construct the smallest # that is divisible by 1 - 20. Ex.(16 has four factors of two, more than any other number in 1 - 20, so we know the target number will have exactly four factors of 2).

19 * 17 * 13 * 11 * 7 * 5 * 3 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 232792560
